# Intra_vehicle_wireless_harness_communication

Our graduation project is sponsored by Dr. Mohamed Raid (EOIP company) & Swift Act.

This project aims to revolutionize the vehicle communication system by transitioning from wired to wireless solutions, focusing on the implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) within a mesh network. The initiative seeks to address challenges inherent in wireless communication, including security and functional safety. We plan to test this wireless approach across three key vehicle systems: the dashboard, lighting, and brake systems.

Our primary objectives include simplifying the installation process by eliminating the need for extensive wiring harnesses and connectors, thereby reducing system complexity. We also aim to offer enhanced flexibility, allowing for easier integration of new features and upgrades through a wireless communication system. The scope of the project involves implementing BLE using the"CC1350" module, building and testing a reliable mesh network with minimal latency, and ensuring compliance with cybersecurity and functional safety standards. We also plan to develop a tailored Linux-based image for the dashboard system using "Yocto" and "QT", and ultimately, expand the project to a larger scale. We aim to end it up with a paperÂ published.
